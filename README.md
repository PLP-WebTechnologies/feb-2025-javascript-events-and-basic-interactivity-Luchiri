This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript to handle form validation, toggle password visibility, and interact with user inputs dynamically. It includes event listeners, simple form validation, and a password visibility toggle functionality.

# Features
- Form Validation- Ensures the user inputs for both username and password are provided.
- Password Visibility Toggle - Allows the user to toggle the visibility of the password field.
- Event Listeners - Used to handle interactions like form submission and button clicks.

# Files
- index.html - The structure of the webpage containing the form and a button to roggle password visibility.
- script.js - JavaScript file handling the form validation, password visibility toggle, and event listeners.
- style.css - Basic CSS for styling the form, input fields, and messages.

# How it Works
- When the form is submitted, it prevents the default action and validates if the username and password fields are filled. If valid, it shows an alert.
- The password isibility can be toggled by clicking the "Show/Hide Password" button.
